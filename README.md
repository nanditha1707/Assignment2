# Assignment2
Our Project is a website on **exploring** the courses in Ngee Ann Poly and letting _potential students_ or their _parents_ to navigate through the website to get to know more about NP. 

## Design Process.
Our **AIM** is to let _Secondary School students_ explore more about NP's Full Time Courses. Through attending some small Quizes <sup>under</sup> the Xplore pages or through the button at the Full Time Courses page, students can get to know more interesting facts about NP.

As a student who was previously finding out about suitable courses in Ngee Ann Poly ourselves, and with our estimated marks before the results were out, we normally tend to worry whether our results would meet the requirements under the courses, however in NP's Official Website, we ~could not~ find where the ELR2B2 range is. It may be because we didn't look through the website that thoroughly, or we maybe just thought that the mark range was going to be written under the specific course page. **BUT..** since we find it difficult to see, we came out with a plan to directly put the ELR2B2 mark range directly at the top of the webpage navigation bar easy for out targetted audience to view the past year range.
